# Yu-Hsin (Peter) Yeh

## About Me
I am a Data Science professional and an MS candidate in Applied Data Science at New College of Florida. Currently, I am focusing on modeling molecular responses to exercise using the MoTrPAC database. My research involves the application of machine learning to biological datasets within a Bioinformatics framework. 

My technical background was established at National Taiwan University, where my work in Deep Learning and Computer Vision was presented at major conferences, including PyCon Taiwan. Professionally, I have extensive experience in the FinTech sector as a Software Developer and a Product Manager where I specialized in developing middle-office platforms and scalable research infrastructure for quantitative traders.
