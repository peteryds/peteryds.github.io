## About Me
I am a data researcher and engineer currently pursuing an MS in Applied Data Science at New College of Florida. My current research focuses on modeling molecular responses to exercise using the [MoTrPAC database](https://motrpac-data.org/), applying machine learning to biological datasets within a bioinformatics framework.

My technical foundation was established at National Taiwan University, where my work in deep learning and computer vision was presented at major conferences, including PyCon Taiwan. Professionally, I bring extensive experience from the FinTech sector as a Data Engineer and Product Manager, having specialized in developing middle-office platforms and research infrastructure for quantitative traders.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Bioinformatics: Exploring Omic Responses to Exercise (Work in Progress)
* **Description:** An ongoing two-stage study to identify systemic molecular determinants of exercise responsiveness. Currently, I have completed Phase 1, establishing a baseline molecular signature from the human GSE47881 dataset using Empirical Bayes for differential gene expression analysis. The planned next phase involves integrating multi-omics animal data (MoTrPAC) and applying LASSO Logistic Regression to predict VO2 max adaptability.
* **Repository:** [Exercise-Omics-Exploration](https://github.com/peteryds/Exercise-Omics-Exploration)
* **Tech Stack:** R (Bioconductor, limma), Statistical Modeling. *(Planned: LASSO Logistic Regression, Multi-Omics Integration)*

### 2. Golf Telemetry ETL & Diagnostic Analytics (Work in Progress)
* **Description:** An ongoing project to build an end-to-end data pipeline processing raw telemetry from a Garmin R10 launch monitor. Currently, I have developed the core Diagnostic Tagging System—a custom algorithm that utilizes dynamic baselines (e.g., Smash Factor, Launch Angle) to automatically classify shot quality and identify mechanical flaws. The next phases involve automating AWS data ingestion (ETL) and building interactive visualizations for actionable coaching insights.
* **Repository:** [golf-telemetry-etl-viz](https://github.com/peteryds/golf-telemetry-etl-viz)
* **Tech Stack:** Data Analysis (Python/R), Domain-Specific Algorithm Design. *(Planned: AWS S3/RDS, Data Visualization)*
