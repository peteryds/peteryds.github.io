## About Me
I am a Data Science professional and an MS candidate in Applied Data Science at New College of Florida. Currently, I am focusing on modeling molecular responses to exercise using the [MoTrPAC database](https://motrpac-data.org/). My research involves the application of machine learning to biological datasets within a Bioinformatics framework. 

My technical background was established at National Taiwan University, where my work in Deep Learning and Computer Vision was presented at major conferences, including PyCon Taiwan. Professionally, I have experience in the FinTech sector as a Software Developer and a Product Manager where I specialized in developing middle-office platforms and scalable research infrastructure for quantitative traders.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Bioinformatics: Exploring Omic Responses to Exercise
* **Description:** A two-stage analytical framework integrating human (GSE47881) and animal (MoTrPAC) datasets to identify systemic molecular determinants of exercise responsiveness. This project applies Empirical Bayes for differential gene expression analysis and utilizes LASSO Logistic Regression on high-dimensional multi-omics profiles to predict VO2 max adaptability.
* **Repository:** [Exercise-Omics-Exploration](https://github.com/peteryds/Exercise-Omics-Exploration)
* **Tech Stack:** R (Bioconductor, limma), LASSO Logistic Regression, Multi-Omics Integration, Statistical Modeling

### 2. Golf Telemetry ETL & Diagnostic Analytics
* **Description:** An end-to-end data pipeline processing raw telemetry from a Garmin R10 launch monitor into actionable coaching insights. I engineered an automated AWS ingestion workflow and developed a custom Diagnostic Tagging System. This algorithm utilizes dynamic baselines across metrics like Smash Factor and Launch Angle to automatically classify shot quality and identify specific mechanical flaws.
